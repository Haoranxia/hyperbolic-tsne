[Notes for this experiment]
In this experiment we notice that clusters are pushed towards the edge very strongly. 
This could be due to the fact that the Poincare Disk only visualizes a tiny fraction of Hyperbolic Space.

So the embedded points that stay true to the high dimensional distances can only be correctly embedded if theyre 
towards the outer edge, as this then means that the distances are consistent. 

For example d^H(-0.99, 0.99) (in Hyperoblic units) is about 20 Euclidean units. 


[Future experiment ideas]
If we reduce the variance for the GaussianKL loss function in Hyperbolic Space, then we can control how spread it gets.
