    "1. Qualitative analysis of t-sne embeddings in hyperbolic vs euclidean space\n",
    "   Do the embeddings make sense? Do we get what we expect out of hyperoblic embeddings? Are the embeddings in hypebolic space better than euclidean space (for the datasets where we expect hyperbolic space to work better)?\n",

    "2. Where do numerical instabilites occur? How can I get these to happen?\n",

    "3. Qualitative analysis of fixed gradient. We have a hypothesis ready for what a fixed gradient may do.\n",
    "   We can test this hypothesis and more?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Experiment with no dimensionality reduction (PCA) as a pre-processing step\n",
    "   It could be that PCA gets rid of the hierarchical structure? I'd have to justify it with a more qualitative explanation instead of just a possibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Track convergence iterations for correct and wrong gradient\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Tune down data size, increase perplexity, to see whether the correct gradient factor affects the attractive forces and embedding\n",

    "7. Implement wrong and corrected version of the gradients of the h-sne, g-sne, poincare maps papers. See if the correct gradient improves those results\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Use wordnet dataset, possibly generate your own hyperbolic data set\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Possible experiment with a non-pca initialization\n",
    "   In the first dimensionality reduction step, pca is applied to the high dimensional data to reduce it down to 50 dimensions. This is then used in the visualization algorithm. \n",
    "   It could be that this step gets rid of (some of) the hierarchical structure inherent to the data making pca reduction a bad actor. I can try experimenting with synthetic (unreduced) data, lower dimensional (but still hierarchical) data, or using a dimensionality reduction technique that retains hierarchical structure (for example poincare embeddings)"

    "In the T-SNE paper, the t-distribution is introduced to fight against the crowding problem. So if in high dimensions we have n equidistant points, then in 2 (embedding) dimensions, we can't faithfully capture this equidistance and instead points will get squished together.\n",

    "To make the points not crush eachother into a small area (crowding), we use a t-distribution for the lower dimensional embeddings to ensure that we can still faithfully capture the same high dimensional probabilities (using less low dimensional space), by spreading the points in low dimensions out more since we are using a heavy-tailed distribution to match affinities.\n",

    "Running the algorithm involves the following stages:\n",
    "1. Initialize **HyperbolicTSNE** object and run the **.fit_transform()** method\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **.fit_transform()** calls the (private) **._fit()** method \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **HyperbolicTSNE** takes in an Optimizer object. In the default case this will be the SequentialOptimizer class\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **SequentialOptimizer** requires a “config” to run properly. These are set at the beginning (before .1), through a dedicated function for initializing the config. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In the default case **.sequence_poincare()** The SequentialOptimizer works by chunking the optimization process into sequences. We can specify each chunk of the sequence through objects (a dictionary) which contains all the info for each block to run properly. These objects/blocks follow a standard format that must be adhered to We get two blocks in the SequentialOptimizer: EarlyExaggeration block and a GradientDescent block through the functions **add_block_early_exaggeration()** and **add_block_gradient_descent_with_rescale_and_gradient_mask()**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each block must internally contain information (see the add_block functions) specifying the optimization strategy to use (e..g gradient descent), and parameters. The optimization method is specified under the “function” dictionary key,  with the “params” key containing the params for the optimization method.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. SequentialOptimizer has a **.run()** method which executes the function (optimization method). By default **.run()** calls the **.gradient_descent()** function in **solver.py**\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The optimization method is specified in the **solver.py** file. \n",
    "Most code here deals with administrative/logging tasks, and other higher level functionality regarding optimization. The default implementation is roughly split into the following parts:\n",
    "- Checks and initializing logging- Gradient computation (using cython implementation of lower level details)\n",
    "- Logging of optimization step- Convergence checks The actual computation of the optimization step is split in several parts:\n",
    "    Higher level detail in optimization method, cost function details in **cost_functions.py**, lower level details in tsne.pyx\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **cost_functions.py** contains the wrapper code that calls the lower level implementation for computing the gradient. We can find the code here for executing exact, or bh-tsne gradient descent. \n",
    "\n",
    "8. **tsne.pyx** contains the low level details of the gradient computation. Here we also find the code for the quad-tree datastructure, exponential map, and other calculation functionality.\n",
